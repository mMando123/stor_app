Architecture
 Stor App is built using the Flutter framework, which provides a reactive and declarative way to build user interfaces. The app uses a simple architecture that consists of a single layer, which contains UI components, state management, and API communication.

The application consists of the following components:

Screens: This layer contains the UI components of the application. It uses the Flutter framework to build reactive and declarative user interfaces.

State management: This layer manages the state of the application, such as user input and API responses. It uses the Provider package to manage state across screens.

API communication: This layer communicates with the API to retrieve and send data. It uses the Dio package to handle HTTP requests and responses.
